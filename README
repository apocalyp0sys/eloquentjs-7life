This is a training project from Eloquent Javascript book (http://eloquentjavascript.net/)
Chapter 7. Project: Electronic Life. Most of the code is taken from there.

Some additional features were implemented just for fun.
Demo should be available here: http://ap-eloquentjs.droppages.com/7life/index.html
